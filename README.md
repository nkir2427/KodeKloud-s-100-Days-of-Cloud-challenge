☁️ KodeKloud – 100 Days of Cloud (AWS & Azure)

There is no better way to refresh my cloud computing knowledge and the industry experience gained over the last six years than through hands-on learning. This belief is exactly why I started KodeKloud’s 100 Days of Cloud challenge.

📘 About the Challenge

The program is structured around 100 practical, execution-focused cloud tasks:

      50 tasks on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

50 tasks on Microsoft Azure

This balanced approach provides exposure to both major cloud platforms while reinforcing core cloud fundamentals that are transferable across providers.

Each task progresses gradually from foundational concepts to more advanced topics, ensuring a steady learning curve rather than an overwhelming one. A key strength of the program is the use of temporary (dummy) credentials, which provide direct access to real AWS and Azure environments.

🛠️ What This Challenge Involves

You’re not just learning theory — you’re actively working in the cloud by:

Provisioning and configuring cloud resources

Managing IAM roles, users, and permissions

Executing CLI commands

Observing how services interact in real cloud environments

Every completed task produces tangible artifacts, such as console configurations, CLI outputs, and screenshots. Over time, these artifacts form a hands-on cloud portfolio that reflects real operational experience.

This approach goes beyond understanding services conceptually — it builds confidence, execution skills, and practical intuition, which can only be gained by working directly within cloud platforms.

📌 Why This Repository?

This repository documents my progress, learnings, and practical implementations throughout the 100 Days of Cloud challenge. It serves as:

a personal learning log, and

a public portfolio demonstrating hands-on cloud experience across AWS and Azure.
