## ☁️ KodeKloud – 100 Days of Cloud (AWS & Azure)

There is no better way to refresh my cloud computing knowledge and the industry experience gained over the last six years than through **hands-on learning**. This belief is exactly why I started **KodeKloud’s 100 Days of Cloud** challenge.

---

## 📘 About the Challenge

The program is structured around **100 practical, execution-focused cloud tasks**:

- **50 tasks on Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **50 tasks on Microsoft Azure**

This balanced approach provides exposure to both major cloud platforms while reinforcing **core cloud fundamentals** that are transferable across providers.

Each task progresses gradually from foundational concepts to more advanced topics, ensuring a steady learning curve rather than an overwhelming one. A key strength of the program is the use of **temporary (dummy) credentials**, which provide direct access to **real AWS and Azure environments**.

## 🛠️ What This Challenge Involves

I am not just refreshing theory — I am actively working in the cloud by:

- Provisioning and configuring cloud resources  
- Managing IAM roles, users, and permissions  
- Executing CLI commands  
- Observing how services interact in real cloud environments  

Every completed task produces **tangible artifacts**, such as console configurations, CLI outputs, and screenshots. Over time, these artifacts form a **hands-on cloud portfolio** that reflects real operational experience.

This approach goes beyond understanding services conceptually — it builds **confidence, execution skills, and practical intuition**, which can only be gained by working directly within cloud platforms.
